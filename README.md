# OOP-Based-System-Design

## AIM:
To design and implement an Online Course Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, demonstrating core concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## PROCEDURE:
### 1.Design UML Diagram:
    Create a class diagram showing relationships between User, Student, Instructor, Course, Assignment, and Grade.

### 2.Define Classes in JavaScript:
    Implement each class with constructors, methods, and properties.
    Use:

        Inheritance (Student, Instructor from User)

        Encapsulation (getters/setters)

        Polymorphism (method overriding like login())
        
### 3.Implement Functionalities:

        Instructor creates a course and assignments

        Student enrolls and submits assignments

        Instructor assigns grades
        
### 4.Test Scenarios:

        Create users, enroll students, upload assignments, and assign grades

        Output results to verify class interaction

  ## PROGRAM:
  JavaScript OOP code with the following structure:
  
    Classes: User, Student, Instructor, Course, Assignment, Grade

    Features: Course creation, enrollment, assignment submission, grading

## RESULT:
A working OOP-based simulation of an Online Course Management System that showcases the use of OOP and SOLID principles, demonstrating design thinking, scalability, and clean architecture.
